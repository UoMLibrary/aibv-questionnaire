# Questionnaire development

```text
I have a set of questions I want to turn into an online questionnaire using Sveltekit (version 5)

The questions are attached, making them JSON would probably be a start.

Then I want a Svelte Quiz component that contains a single page of all the questions in their relevant sections.

Different qustions types such as multiple selection, 1 to 5 rating, free text etc should be implemented as Question components

I want the users progress to be stored locally and kept up to date as the progress to avoid data loss

I want an indicator that shows their progress

I want a clean, modern and tidy look to the questionairre

As close as possible it should be easy and... fun? to fill in
```
